		<h4 class="border-bottom pb-2 pt-4">How long did it take you to build it?</h4>
		<h5 class="font-weight-normal">Around 20 man-days.</h5>

		<h4 class="border-bottom pb-2 pt-4">What's its purpose?</h4>
		<h5 class="font-weight-normal">This site offers a personalized smartphone recommendation based on 3 simple steps. Budget, features and types of use. An advanced recommendation algorithm takes place under the hood, that will always suggest the top 3 smartphones on the results page.</h5>

		<h4 class="border-bottom pb-2 pt-4">Database information?</h4>
		<h5 class="font-weight-normal">Due to hardware limitations, the project is currently using a JSON file as a database. This file can be used as a MongoDB collection on stronger machines, but since it is hosted on an entry level tiny server I preferred not to install mongodb. The database consists of around 600 smartphones and was last updated on April 2019.</h5>

		<h4 class="border-bottom pb-2 pt-4">Which features are currently non functional / useless?</h4>
		<h5 class="font-weight-normal">

			<ul>
				<li class="pb-2">The search bar on the top navbar supports autocomplete of all the smartphones, but once you click on a name nothing happens.</li>
				<li class="pb-2">The log in / register functionality is there but it's extremely basic, even password validation is missing (you can register with empty username and pass hooray!)</li>
				<li class="pb-2">The smartphones-database page is for demonstration purposes only, to show how ajax requests based on autocomplete suggestion dynamically change the content of the page.</li>
				<li class="pb-2">The compare and details buttons on the results page do nothing at the moment.</li>
			</ul>
			
		</h5>

		<h4 class="border-bottom pb-2 pt-4">What was the most challenging thing in this project?</h4>
		<h5 class="font-weight-normal">The hardest part was definitely on the extra features step where the user can select as many features as they like. Each time a feature is clicked, an AJAX request is sent to the server checking if each one of the unselected features produces at least 3 devices in combination with the selected features. Those that don't, are automatically being rendered unavailable.</h5>
